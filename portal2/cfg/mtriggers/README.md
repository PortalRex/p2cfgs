# Portal 2 mtriggers

This repo contains a collection of [SAR] speedrun categories for individual
Portal 2 maps (also known as 'mtriggers'), primarily intended for use in
challenge mode (CM).

[SAR]: https://github.com/p2sr/SourceAutoRecord

## Usage

To use these, place the entire repository (in a directory named `mtriggers`)
within your `portal2/cfg` directory. Then, in your autoexec (or somewhere else),
simply run `exec mtriggers/mtriggers`.

## Contributing

All contributions to these triggers are welcome; feel free to open a PR, or
message me an improvement on Discord (mlugg#6618).

Note that because of the squash-based workflow used, PRs may be merged manually;
this means they may show on GitHub as 'closed' rather than 'merged'. Don't
worry; your changes have still made it in!

### Commit Format

Conventional commits should be followed. Valid commit types include `fix` (for
fixing typos and bugs), `refactor` (for e.g. mass style or syntax changes),
`docs` (for documentation), and `feat` (for functional changes to the triggers).
